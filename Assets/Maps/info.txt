`releaseAt` expects a UNIX TIMESTAMP (https://www.unixtimestamp.com/) aka big number

if releaseAt is set in mapname.json everything besides author and image is ignored and the "upcoming" template is used, do not have to fill in anything else.
Standard image is "Assets/none.png".

Otherwise it is populated with data in the other fields and displayed in "Current Maps" or "Previous Maps" depending on isCurrent flag
